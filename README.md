### Design Principles 

Power BI is a versatile set of tools that brings together diverse data sources, ranging from Excel 
spreadsheets to hybrid data warehouses. It simplifies the process of connecting, visualizing, 
and understanding data, catering to both cloud-based and on-premises sources. Designed for 
analysts, Power BI allows them to independently extract, transform, visualize, and share 
insights without constant IT involvement. The tool supports iterative analysis, empowering 
analysts to enhance reports over time with new measures or dimensions. Its user-friendly 
interface puts Business Intelligence creation directly in the hands of those who understand the 
data best, fostering collaboration and enabling flexible adaptation to evolving business needs. 

1. Data 
We leveraged SQL queries to extract profit and trend data, adding depth to our analysis. üåê User-Friendly & Real-Time: Our solution prioritizes user-friendliness and real-time access, ensuring it's a valuable tool for the sales team and management. 

2. Processing 
Worked on Data Modelling where relationships are defined between the data to be analyzed 
and finally figuring out the best ways to plot that data such as using bar graphs and pie charts 
for comparison, scatter plots for distribution and dual axis lines for trends. For better 
understanding of the data 

 
3. Created a dashboard for Axon, a small retailer of classic automobiles that was having trouble organizing and interpreting their sales data.

4. Business Problem Overview: Axon's inability to effectively manage and analyze their sales data was affecting their ability to make decisions. Accurate and current sales reports were difficult to find in the absence of a centralized system.


üí°  Our solution has empowered Axon to effectively manage and analyze sales data, resulting in improved decision-making processes. üìäüìà


üîÖConclusion: This project successfully addressed Axon's sales data challenges, providing a robust BI solution that enhances decision-making. 

üé¢ Future Recommendations: In the future, we suggest growing data sources and maintaining data quality control for even more thorough research.

### Insights

Different dashboards were crafted with drill down capabilities which helped to visually go through important information like:

‚Ä¢ Sales throughout the specified time period and how they vary by Year, Quarter, Month,

insight into, for example, which region had the highest sales and profits in relation to

businesses decide which ones to keep making and which ones to cut back on. 

‚Ä¢ One can gain an understanding of how sales profit is allocated among various product 
lines in each territory by examining the Sales Profit by Product Line in Separate 
Territory report. 

‚Ä¢ The order status visual was developed to display the total number of orders that have 
been shipped, cancelled, resolved, in process, placed on hold, or disputed by a specific 
aspect. With the aid of an interactive visual report, we can observe the overall sales 
view.
