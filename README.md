# Data Visualization through PowerBI On Retail Automobile Sales Company
### Design Principles 

Power BI is a versatile set of tools that brings together diverse data sources, ranging from Excel 
spreadsheets to hybrid data warehouses. It simplifies the process of connecting, visualizing, 
and understanding data, catering to both cloud-based and on-premises sources. Designed for 
analysts, Power BI allows them to independently extract, transform, visualize, and share 
insights without constant IT involvement. The tool supports iterative analysis, empowering 
analysts to enhance reports over time with new measures or dimensions. Its user-friendly 
interface puts Business Intelligence creation directly in the hands of those who understand the 
data best, fostering collaboration and enabling flexible adaptation to evolving business needs. 

1. Data 
We leveraged SQL queries to extract profit and trend data, adding depth to our analysis. 🌐 User-Friendly & Real-Time: Our solution prioritizes user-friendliness and real-time access, ensuring it's a valuable tool for the sales team and management. 

2. Processing 
Worked on Data Modelling where relationships are defined between the data to be analyzed 
and finally figuring out the best ways to plot that data such as using bar graphs and pie charts 
for comparison, scatter plots for distribution and dual axis lines for trends. For better 
understanding of the data 

 
3. Created a dashboard for Axon, a small retailer of classic automobiles that was having trouble organizing and interpreting their sales data.

4. Business Problem Overview: Axon's inability to effectively manage and analyze their sales data was affecting their ability to make decisions. Accurate and current sales reports were difficult to find in the absence of a centralized system.


💡  Our solution has empowered Axon to effectively manage and analyze sales data, resulting in improved decision-making processes. 📊📈


🔅Conclusion: This project successfully addressed Axon's sales data challenges, providing a robust BI solution that enhances decision-making. 

🎢 Future Recommendations: In the future, we suggest growing data sources and maintaining data quality control for even more thorough research.
